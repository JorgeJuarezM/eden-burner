"""
Background Worker System for EPSON PP-100 Disc Burner Application

This module implements a comprehensive background processing system that manages
job processing and API polling when the GUI is closed or running in system tray mode.

Architecture:
    - Event-driven scheduling system using the `schedule` library
    - Multi-threaded job processing with proper synchronization
    - API polling for new ISO discoveries
    - Database maintenance and cleanup operations
    - System monitoring and statistics collection

Components:
    - BackgroundWorker: Main coordinator class
    - Scheduler integration: Periodic task execution
    - Job queue monitoring: Ready job detection and processing
    - Database maintenance: Backup, cleanup, statistics
    - API integration: ISO discovery and status updates

Scheduling System:
    - API polling: Configurable interval for checking new ISOs
    - Job cleanup: Daily cleanup of old completed/failed jobs
    - Download cleanup: Periodic cleanup of old download cache
    - Database maintenance: Backup creation and old backup removal
    - Statistics collection: System performance monitoring

Threading Model:
    - Main background thread: Runs scheduler and monitors job queue
    - Worker threads: Individual job processing tasks
    - Synchronization: Proper locking for shared resources

Features:
    - Automatic retry mechanism for failed operations
    - Graceful shutdown with cleanup
    - Comprehensive logging and error reporting
    - Real-time status monitoring and reporting
    - Configurable intervals and timeouts
    - System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)

Error Handling:
    - Exception isolation prevents scheduler crashes
    - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
    - Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
    - Graceful degradation on component failures

    Background worker that manages job processing and API polling.

    This class implements a comprehensive background processing system that handles
    job queue monitoring, API polling for new ISOs, and scheduled maintenance tasks.
    It operates independently of the GUI, allowing the application to continue
    processing jobs even when the main window is closed.

    Key Responsibilities:
        - Monitor job queue for ready-to-process jobs
        - Poll GraphQL API for new ISO discoveries
        - Execute scheduled maintenance tasks (cleanup, backups)
        - Provide real-time status and statistics
        - Handle graceful startup and shutdown

    Threading Strategy:
        - Runs in dedicated background thread using threading.Thread
        - Uses daemon thread to prevent blocking application exit
        - Proper synchronization with job queue operations
        - Exception isolation to prevent scheduler crashes

    Scheduling Tasks:
        - API polling (configurable interval)
        - Job cleanup (daily)
        - Download cache cleanup (24 hours)
        - Database maintenance (24 hours)
        - Statistics collection (ongoing)

    Integration Points:
        - JobQueue: For job processing coordination
        - GraphQLClient: For API communication
        - LocalStorage: For database maintenance
        - Configuration: For interval and timeout settings
